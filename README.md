# Bioenergy expansion and post-2020 biodiversity conservation targets

## Background
This text outlines the structure of the GitHub repository associated with the paper titled "XXX". The repository contains R and Python code, related to the analysis and visualization of conflicts and synergies in biodiversity and bioenergy expansion.

## Repository Structure

The GitHub repository is organized to facilitate easy access to the code, data, and results produced during the research process. The main components of the repository include:

### 1. R code
- **Folder Name:** `R`
- **Description:** This folder contains R scripts and associated data files used to generate figures and visualizations related to the biodiversity analysis. 


### 2. Notebooks (Jupyter)
- **Folder Name:** `notebooks`
- **Description:** This folder contains a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb files) that focus on the extraction of percentages of bionergey for the top fraction of the landscape 

### 3. Figures
- **Folder Name:** `figures`
- **Description:** This folder contains figures produced with the R scripts.

### 3. PDF docs with readbility of the code
- **Folder Name:** `pdf`
- **Description:** This folder contains PDF versions of the Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown documents used in the paper. These PDFs are provided for the convenience of reviewers and readers who may prefer a static, printable format for reviewing the code and results.

## How to Use the Repository, R project and Jupyter notebook

To access the content of this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** You can clone the repository using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

2. **R code** The R code is structured in R project format. No relative paths need to specified when reproducing the analyses. The Rproj file can be used to open it. 

3. **Jupyter notebook** The notebook can be run as as standalone notebook using jupyter notebooks, jupyter lab, or similar. Note that the Python Earth Engine API should be installed. Alternatively it can be imported into Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and run from there.
