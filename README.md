# Bioenergy Expansion and Post-2020 Biodiversity Conservation Targets

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the GitHub repository associated with the paper titled "XXX." The repository contains R and Python code related to the analysis and visualization of conflicts and synergies in biodiversity and bioenergy expansion.

## Repository Structure

The GitHub repository is organized to facilitate easy access to the code, data, and results produced during the research process. The main components of the repository include:

### 1. R Code
- **Folder Name:** `R`
- **Description:** This folder contains R scripts and associated data files used to generate figures and visualizations related to the biodiversity analysis. 

### 2. Notebooks (Jupyter)
- **Folder Name:** `notebooks`
- **Description:** This folder contains Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) that focus on the extraction of percentages of bioenergy for the top fraction of the landscape.

### 3. Figures
- **Folder Name:** `figures`
- **Description:** This folder contains figures produced with the R scripts.

### 4. PDF Docs with Code Readability
- **Folder Name:** `pdf`
- **Description:** This folder contains PDF versions of the Jupyter notebooks and R Markdown documents used in the paper. These PDFs are provided for the convenience of reviewers and readers who may prefer a static, printable format for reviewing the code and results.

## How to Use the Repository, R Project, and Jupyter Notebook
